# About me 

<body style="font-family: 'Calibri', sans-serif;">

I am a first-year PhD student in Economics at Bocconi University. 

I am interested in applied microeconomics, particularly education and development economics. 

Prior to joining Bocconi, I received an MA in Economics from Columbia University, a BA in Economics and a BSc in Mathematics and Statistics from Universidad Complutense de Madrid.
